  - "For Lang Commerce grad Tara Lalani (BComm â€™20), starting her career was as simple as beginning her first co-op term. Tara began her first co-op term at RBC during her second year, and quickly left an impression. Tara is a typical Lang Commerce student: hardworking, collaborative and determined. RBC quickly saw potential in Tara and brought her back for all of her co-op terms. Before graduating, Tara was informed she had a job waiting for her at RBC in marketing and communications."
  - And it all started at Lang.
